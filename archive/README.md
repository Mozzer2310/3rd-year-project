# About
This folder contains files which were used during the development of this project.

## File Sources
- `camshift.cpp` - From [OpenCV Meanshift and Camshift demo](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/d7/d00/tutorial_meanshift.html)
- `camshiftdemo.cpp` - From [OpenCV samples/cpp/camshiftdemo.cpp](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/d6/d7f/samples_2cpp_2camshiftdemo_8cpp-example.html)
- `mser.cpp` and `mser_test.cpp` - made by me inspired by multiple sources

## Other notes
There were multiple other systems/tools tested during the course of development, such as YOLOv5 and other peoples object tracking implementations, but the files above were the focus of my initial experimentation and ideas.
